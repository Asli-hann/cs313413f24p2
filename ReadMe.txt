TestIterator.java

1. Imports
Added import java.lang.* to include the required language packages.

2. setUp() Method
ArrayList vs. LinkedList:
The code uses an ArrayList by default, but switching to a LinkedList results in only minor differences.
ArrayList is faster for random access, while LinkedList is faster for frequent insertions/removals in the middle of the list.

3. testNonempty() Method
Updated the expected values in the assertions to correctly match the list elements.

4. testRemove() Method
Using Iterator for Removal:
If list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77)) is used inside the loop, we get a ConcurrentModificationException error due to modifying the list directly while using an iterator, that is why it is safer to use an iterator while removing the element.

Assertion:
After removing all occurrences of 77, assertEquals(List.of(33,44,55,66),list) added to check if the final version of the list is matching with the expectation.

5. testAverageValues() Method
Average Calculation:
An iterator and a while loop added to compute the mean.
