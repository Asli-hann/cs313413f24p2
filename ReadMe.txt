TestIterator.java

1. Imports
Added import java.lang.* to include the required language packages.

2. setUp() Method
ArrayList vs. LinkedList:
The code uses an ArrayList by default, but switching to a LinkedList results in only minor differences.
ArrayList is faster for random access, while LinkedList is faster for frequent insertions/removals in the middle of the list.

3. testNonempty() Method
Updated the expected values in the assertions to correctly match the list elements.

4. testRemove() Method
Using Iterator for Removal:
If list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77)) is used inside the loop, we get a ConcurrentModificationException error due to modifying the list directly while using an iterator, that is why it is safer to use an iterator while removing the element.

Assertion:
After removing all occurrences of 77, assertEquals(List.of(33,44,55,66),list) added to check if the final version of the list is matching with the expectation.

5. testAverageValues() Method
Average Calculation:
An iterator and a while loop added to compute the mean.

TestList.java
1. setUp() Method
ArrayList is typically faster than LinkedList for random access operations
because it allows direct indexing. In this test case ArrayList is 1ms faster.

2. testSizeNonEmpty()
Changed list.isEmpty() to return false, set the expected list size to 1,
and the expected value at index 0 to 77.
3. testContains()
Added assertFalse() and assertTrue() to check if the list contains the
integer 77 before and after adding it.

4. testAddMultiple()
Updated the expected size of the list and verified the first and
last indices of the value 77.

5. testAddMultiple2()
Similar to testAddMultiple(), updated the expected values for size,
indices, and specific elements.
6. testRemoveObject()
Updated the expected values to compare the list before and after removing
specific items using both index-based and object-based removal.

7.testContainsAll()
Used list.containsAll() to verify that the
necessary elements are present and absent in the list.

8. testAddAll()
Added all items in the assertions to the list using the addAll() method.

9. testRemoveAll()
Removed all items except the ones in the assertion using removeAll().

10. testRetainAll()
Used retainAll() to remove all elements from the list except for 77.

11. testSet()
Replaced the values at specific indices using the set() method to
match the expected ones.
12. testSubList()
Corrected the indices in the subList() method to match the expected output.
